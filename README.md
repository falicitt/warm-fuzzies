Things to think of WHILE planning your project and AFTER discussing the things above:
1. What is your MVP? How much work do you think it will take to achieve it?
- a landing page to create a board with the person's name, a page to enter comments/compliments for the person, and a final page to display all the comments. 
- we'll need 3 routes, a post route for the board table, a post route for comments(texts or images), a get route to display all the comments.
- stretch: beautiful css, patch and delete route to update and delete comments, authentication(log in and send link), update and delete comments.

2. What tech will you be using? Is there anything you need to research? If you’re using our stack, will you use Redux?
- We'll try to use Redux
- the uploading photos, and how to store images in the database
- css frameworks

3. GitFlow. How will you arrange your work?
- before merging to main, have each other to check and merge pull request
- have a dev branch after MVP finished
- decide on the branch name: feature-name
- delete the branch when the feature is finished, and start a new branch

4. Roles. Which will you use? Who will be accountable for which areas?
- Frontend Lead: Andrea
- Gitkeeper: Cassie
- Scrum Master: Chris
- Product owner: Emma

5. What might a day look like? What agile rituals will happen?
- go with individual needs with breaks
- have a stand-up in the morning, before lunch, mid-afternoon, and be flexible.

6. When during the day will you do the hard tech?
- in the morning
- whenever I feel ready

7. Will you go outside as a team?
- possibly
- we'll do an outside stand-up

8. Documentation. Set up a repo and a readme, start adding things to it
- done

10. Set up a kanban board (To Do, Up Next, In Progress, Done)
* [Warm Fuzzies Kanban Board](https://dev-academy-aotearoa.slack.com/archives/C03P9Q5G2CS/p1657682519907639)


11. Draw your wireframes, make some user stories, do some DB diagrams, global store plans, etc.


12. What data will be interacted with on what pages?

Once you’ve planned the technical side, come show us the following (and make them accessible to us):
- MVP (what is and is not part of MVP?)
- Wireframes
- User Stories
