1. Wellbeing (when I’m stressed ... I need...) (general needs eg. kids, illness, sleep etc)
- a good laugh
- reassurance
- time alone / take breaks
- discuss the problem

2. Expectation setting and agreements (what do we each want out of this time, what hours will we keep, what do we do when conflict arises, how will we communicate, especially what hours work will happen over the weekend)
- finish the MVP
- work normal hours on weekdays and Saturday if needed
- have stand-ups
- present each piece of work when finished and get feedback from the team
- have each other to check and merge pull request

3. How will you make decisions together? How will you handle conflict?
- be honest and say how you feel early
- don't take it personally

4. How will you, individually and as a team, get the help you need (both technically and non-technically)?
- askfor help from facilitators

5. How will you make sure everyone feels included?
- check-in with each other
- ask for help when needed

6. How will you decide who needs to be present for which conversations
- mainly everyone would be involved, unless it's a specific problem

7. How will we work (what roles and what agile rituals will we use etc)
- Frontend Lead: Andrea
- Gitkeeper: Cassie
- Scrum Master: Chris
- Product owner: Emma

- reflect 
- standup (10-min timer)
- sprints
- pivots
- retrospective

8. How will you survive (Will you eat together? How will you break the tension? What is your fun times plan?)
- timtams
- boardgame
- try and have a laugh
- cuppa tea


Things to think of WHILE planning your project and AFTER discussing the things above:
1. What is your MVP? How much work do you think it will take to achieve it?
- a landing page to create a board with the person's name, a page to enter comments/compliments for the person, and a final page to display all the comments. 
- we'll need 3 routes, a post route to create the board table, a post route to create comments, a get route to display all the comments.
- stretch: beautiful css, authentication(log in and send link), update and delete comments.

3. What tech will you be using? Is there anything you need to research? If you’re using our stack, will you use Redux?
- We'll try to use Redux.

5. GitFlow. How will you arrange your work?
6. Roles. Which will you use? Who will be accountable for which areas?
7. What might a day look like? What agile rituals will happen?
8. When during the day will you do the hard tech?
9. Will you go outside as a team?
10. Documentation. Set up a repo and a readme, start adding things to it
11. Set up a kanban board (To Do, Up Next, In Progress, Done)
12. Draw your wireframes, make some user stories, do some DB diagrams, global store plans, etc.
13. What data will be interacted with on what pages?

Once you’ve planned the technical side, come show us the following (and make them accessible to us):
- MVP (what is and is not part of MVP?)
- Wireframes
- User Stories
